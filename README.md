# Data Distribution API for VIVO

## Purpose

Create data feeds from your VIVO site just by editing a configuration file. 

Use the feeds to:

* provide content to other sites,
* service AJAX requests from your own VIVO pages,
* provide a more responsive user interface on your VIVO site, 
* drive visualizations of your VIVO data.

Get more use of the data in your VIVO site,

* without opening your site to expensive queries,
* without digging into the internals of VIVO,
* without writing any Java code.

_You will likely need to know SPARQL, and the structure of how your data is stored in VIVO._

## Applicability

Currently, the Data Distribution API can be used with:

* VIVO 1.11.0
* VIVO 1.10 
* VIVO 1.9 
* VIVO 1.8 

(or other products that are based on those Vitro releases).
